\section{Situational Description}
\subsection{The company}
The client company, Instok, is a startup company in Curitiba, Brazil. Currently they consist of 4 members with the following roles: CEO, CFO, Marketing, and Sales. It was founded in November 2016 and is currently preparing its product for launch (planned July 2017). The company has been constructed and is being managed based on the methods explained in the book "The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses" by Eric Ries. 

\subsubsection{The product}
Instok will provide their customers with a mobile application and website that allows customers to browse through a product catalogue that features products from store warehouses (so the products that are on display inside the stores, but are still in stock). They do this from the perspective of reducing sleeping capital for stores, while allowing the application to function as an online outlet store. This allows the customer to buy out of season clothes that are left over from the collection for a lower price, and the store owners are able to sell their products in stock which would otherwise have been sitting in the warehouse without any exposure to customers.\\
According to research of Instok, this is an entirely untapped market. Conversations with store owners and managers have shown that this is a problem that has existed for many years, and nobody has found a sustainable solution. Some of the larger chains have set up their own outlets, but many smaller store chains and privately owned stores don't have the capital to do this. For them items in their stock are sleeping capital \parencite{SNELL2009} and some store managers have mentioned that they have items in their stock that have been there for over a year.\\
Instok's product is still under development, and Instok has recently started recruiting programmers to fulfil its product development needs. 

\subsection{The choice of client}
The CEO of Instok has approached me to consult them in developing their HR (Human Resource) Policies, as well as assist them in recruiting and interviewing candidates. I decided to consult this company because the opportunity to consult a company on the very fundamentals of HR Management seemed like a great personal challenge. The company is in a critical stage in its development and the opportunity to assist them in achieving their goals appealed to me greatly. This is also linked to me having an interest in seeing the results of my efforts. In a smaller organization this is generally easier. In the past few years I have discovered that I'm generally more attracted to smaller organizations, and this research may help many more than solely Instok.

\subsection{Problem Orientation}
In this subsection the problem of the client will be explored.\\

\subsubsection{Client needs}
As stated above, the client has recently begun its recruiting efforts in order to recruit personnel to both develop the product further as well as fulfil other functions. However, Instok, being a very young company, does not have a framework to recruit, hire, or maintain personnel apart from the founders of the company. \\
The CEO of the company indicated he's interested in starting small, thinking big. He said this means to make a system that can be applied to a company with only a few applicants and subsequently improved to suit the company's needs in the future.

\subsubsection{General problem} It has been recognized that startups struggle with HR related issues more often than not (\parencite{FUNG2012},\parencite{WEISSMAN2016},\parencite{BUCH2016}). Nowadays there is a tendency to neglect HR in a startup, and this can lead to uncomfortable situations \parencite{WEISSMAN2016}. In many startups HR is seen as a bureaucratic activity that stifles the creativity and the dynamic environment of the company \parencite{FUNG2012}. But this is a stereotypical view of HR, and it's important for startups to realize that HR is much more than a necessary evil \parencite{WEISSMAN2016}. Having 

\section{Research Objective}
In order to consult Instok on its HR policies, it's important to create a primary objective for the project. In this project, HR policies are defined by \cite{HRCA2016} as: 

\begin{displayquote}
"A policy is a formal statement of a principle or rule that members of an organization must follow. Each policy addresses an issue important to the organization's mission or operations."
\end{displayquote}

After conversing with the CEO of Instok I have come to the conclusion that the primary research objective can be specified as:\\
"The objective of this project is to consult Instok on the best way to set up HR Policies that are easily implemented by non-specialists in the field as well as easily maintained over time when necessary."\\
To reach this objective, a set of questions needs to be answered. It must be understood that this project does not entail the creation of each and every HR Policy for Instok, it aims to to consult the company on the best way to create these policies based the items that will be listed later in this document. 

\subsection{Research questions}
As mentioned before, to reach the primary research objective a set of questions needs to be answered, namely:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Does Instok need HR policies?
\item Under what law does Instok operate?
\item What areas will Instok need HR policies for?
\item What is the best way for Instok to create HR policies?
%\item What is the management style of the company?
%\item What is the target group of Instok regarding recruitment?
%\item What is the effect of the answers to the previous questions on the development of the HR function?
\end{enumerate}

These questions serve as the skeleton for the research. In the next section the Methodology (the way to answer these questions) will be explained.

%\subsection{Indicators of success}
%In dialogue with the CEO, a primary research objective has been established and after that the questions to reach the objective have been answered. Now how will we know if the project was a success? This subsection will explain which metrics will be used to measure the success of the project.\\


\section{Methodology}
The methodology of this research is aimed at creating a research that is feasible within the allotted time (June 2017) while allowing for sufficient reliability and validity. An important item to start with is the way the client is organized. As stated earlier, the company is organized according to the principles laid out in the book by Eric Ries. This has a profound effect on how processes and projects are organized within the company \parencite{RIES2011}. This has an effect on how the processes should be developed, which, in turn, has an effect on the recommendation to develop the processes.\\
In order to create strategic HR policies that will serve the client in the long term, it's important to check what's most effective in other companies \parencite{SNL2013}. This research will look at which HR policies are the most relevant for Instok. It will do this by performing peer company research in order to get a more local picture, and by conducting literature research. \cite{HRCA2016} also stated that it's important to talk to the employees of the company to see if anything is not clear in the current situation of Instok that would benefit from an HR policy.

\subsection{Speaking to Instok employees}
Contact with the employees of Instok will provide data on the current situation within the client company and will establish attention areas for the HR policies. Because this topic has many facets, open interviews will be held. In these interviews employees will only be asked one question: "Is there anything in the Instok organization that is not clear to you?"\\
After this questions, the researcher will ask deepening questions on whatever subjects come up in order to get a better understanding of the issues.

\subsection{Peer company research}
Peer company research will be conducted to answer the following research question: "Does Instok need HR policies?" It will also aim to explore which policies Instok might need.\\

Curitiba is one of the cities in Brazil that boasts an impressive number of startups \parencite{SANTANA2016}. Peer company research will be done amongst startups that share the following characteristics with Instok:
\begin{itemize}
\item They are <2 years old
\item They are active with an online product platform
\item They have <15 employees
\item They operate according to the LEAN Startup framework as proposed by \cite{RIES2011}
\end{itemize}

One can imagine that this leaves a large number of startups in the sample. The optimal research method in this case would be interviews, since it's important to receive in-depth information about the situation of the companies and their HR policies. For in-depth research generally 20 interviews are necessary \parencite{BAKEREDWARDS2012}, this is supported by \cite{SNL2013}, who state that for meaningful analysis, a peer group should not be larger than 20 companies. For this purpose, the researcher will visit startup coworking spaces in Curitiba to find the companies that conform to the criteria mentioned above. The following startup hubs will be visited: Impact Hub Curitiba, IBQP Curitiba, Aldeia Coworking, Nex Coworking, and Open Office. These are all places within Curitiba that facilitate the growth and interaction of startups. \\

With a sample of these startups, semi-structured interviews will be held in Portuguese. Semi-structured interviews will allow for clear questions to be asked by the research, while facilitating the interviewee to mention items that were previously not included in the interview. In this situation, where every company is different and various themes are present, a structured interview might miss valuable data. The following questions will be asked to the peer companies, these questions are based on the research objective and the sub-questions as stated earlier in this document.
\begin{itemize}
\item Does your company have HR policies? Why/why not?
\item What kind of HR policies are present?
\item If no HR policies are present, how are agreements regarding HR items made inside your company?
\item What was the creation of the HR policies in your company like?
%\item What is the management style of your company?
%\item What is the target group of your company regarding recruitment?
\end{itemize}

In addition to these questions, the researcher also reserves the right to ask questions to clarify items that come up in the interview. The researcher will take note of the items that come up in the interview. In qualitative research people often suggest recording and transcribing the interviews (\parencite{HUMBLE}, \parencite{BAILEY2008}, \parencite{THOMSON2014}). However, since in this research it is less important to look at the specific behaviour of the people and the questions are more focused on factual data, notes will suffice.

\subsection{Literature research}
In addition to the peer company research, literature research will be done in order to answer the remaining research questions: "Under what law does Instok operate?" As can be easily deducted, the law of the country where a company operates has a profound effect on the HR policies of this company. Therefore, this has an effect on the recommendations for HR the development of its policies.\\
In addition to answering the above research question, the literature research will also search to confirm or contest the results of the semi-structured interviews. It aims to connect the results to the literature to generate an overview of the situation that is as complete as possible.	The literature review will be a "Traditional or Narrative literature Review" as defined by the \cite{TOLEDO2016}. This means that the literature review will focus on the connection proposed by well-known theories between the way HR policies are developed and the characteristics of the companies they are developed in, with a focus on LEAN Startups \parencite{RIES2011}. The researcher will search the Google and Google scholar search engines for the following keywords: HR policies development, HR policies in startups, HR policies lean startup, HR policies in LEAN enterprises.

\section{Chronograph}
